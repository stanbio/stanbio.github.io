Mechanistic models are necessary for inference with latent variables (as in pharmacology when there is interest in concentration within an internal organ) and useful for learning and extrapolating from sparse data. We discuss statistical and computational challenges we have resolved, along with some open problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArman Oganisian, Brown University\n\n\n\nBayesian Causal Inference with Survival Outcomes\n\n\nWhen randomized control trials are infeasible, observational studies are often conducted to estimate causal effects of treatment on survival outcomes. Since treatments are not randomized in observational studies, formal causal inference techniques are required to adjust for observed confounding. The Bayesian approach to causal estimation is desirable because it provides 1) prior smoothing of causal effect estimates, 2) flexible semiparametric models that are robust to misspecification, 3) posterior uncertainty quantification for causal effects. In this talk, we will first discuss Bayesian causal inference methods that accommodate the unique complexities of survival outcomes. Second, we showcase how these methods can be implemented using our open-source R package, causalBETA (“B”ayesian “E”vent “T”ime “A”nalysis). This package provides an intuitive user interface, custom S3 classes for easy plotting and diagnostics, and back-ends to Stan for efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Grant, BayesCamp\n\n\n\nBayesian meta-analysis can solve many problems in evidence synthesis, and is easier than you think\n\n\nMeta-analysis presents several methodological challenges when synthesizing evidence across studies, particularly in scenarios where conventional asymptotic approximations become unreliable. Bayesian methods offer a natural framework for evidence synthesis through their flexible treatment of uncertainty. The Bayesian paradigm accommodates sparse data structures, evidence beyond the study data, systematic biases, and missing study information. It leads to probabilistic outputs that directly address decision-makers’ needs and allow easier interpretation.\nWe present findings from our comprehensive review of models and software in a new book, “Bayesian Meta-Analysis: a practical introduction”, and from a scoping review and its ongoing update. This has shown the potential for many widespread problems in meta-analysis to be addressed in the near future.\nWe challenge the perception that Bayesian methods are inaccessible to non-statistical researchers, illustrating simple and flexible implementation in Stan and brms. Bayesian meta-analysis extends naturally to network meta-analysis and living evidence synthesis from its foundations as a class of multilevel models. We also present practical guidance on prior specification and model validation to complete a reliable Bayesian workflow. Importantly, regulatory agencies and major journals increasingly recognize the value of Bayesian meta-analytic approaches, reflecting their growing adoption in high-impact research synthesis."

    "text": "Question\n\n\n\nWhat is StanBio Connect?\n\n\nStanBio Connect is a conference dedicated to exploring and advancing the use of Stan in biomedical research. It brings together statisticians, data scientists, clinicians, and researchers who leverage probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference to tackle challenges in medicine, public health, and life sciences. The conference aims to cover topics such as drug discovery, clinical trial analysis, survival modeling, pharmacometrics, health policy, RWE, and personalized medicine. StanBio Connect serves as a platform for knowledge sharing, fostering collaboration between academic institutions, industry professionals, and regulatory agencies. Whether you are an experienced Stan user or new to Bayesian modeling, this conference provides an opportunity to learn, network, and contribute to the growing intersection of Bayesian computation and biomedical science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhy Stan for biomedical applications?\n\n\nStan is an excellent tool for biomedical applications because it enables researchers to build sophisticated probabilistic models with high computational efficiency and flexibility. Bayesian inference, which is central to Stan, allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge and provides robust uncertainty quantification—critical in biomedical research where data is often sparse, noisy, or hierarchical. Stan’s dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling ensures efficient and scalable inference, making it particularly useful for complex models such as pharmacokinetics, disease progression modeling, survival analysis, and clinical trial data synthesis. Moreover, its rich modeling language and integration with R, Python, and other statistical computing environments make it accessible to both statisticians and applied scientists. By leveraging Stan, biomedical researchers can generate more reliable estimates, improve predictive accuracy, and ultimately make more informed decisions in healthcare and medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWho should attend?\n\n\nWe welcome researchers, students, clinicians, statisticians, data scientists, and innocent bystanders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIf I am a presenter, do you need my slides ahead of time?\n\n\nNo! We don’t need to pre-screen your slides; we hate it when other organizers ask us to submit them beforehand. However, if you are not an expert presenter, we have some recommendations for you. First of all, you should check out “Confessions of a Public Speaker” by Scott Berkun. Second, we offer a 30-minute session to review your slides and give you pointers on improving them. We promise not to be annoying about it. If you are interested, simply indicate so on the abstract submission form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat equipment do I need?\n\n\nIf you are an attendee, you don’t need anything other than a browser. There are no plugins or external applications to install. If you are a presenter, you need good lighting, fast internet, and a high-quality microphone. If you don’t have a high-quality microphone, let us know and we will buy one for you. Yes, you heard that right, we really care about quality video/audio."
