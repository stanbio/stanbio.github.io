What is StanBio Connect?
:::

StanBio Connect is a conference dedicated to exploring and advancing the use of Stan in biomedical research. It brings together statisticians, data scientists, clinicians, and researchers who leverage probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference to tackle challenges in medicine, public health, and life sciences. The conference aims to cover topics such as clinical trial analysis, survival modeling, pharmacometrics, and personalized medicine. StanBio Connect serves as a platform for knowledge sharing, fostering collaboration between academic institutions, industry professionals, and regulatory agencies. Whether you are an experienced Stan user or new to Bayesian modeling, this conference provides an opportunity to learn, network, and contribute to the growing intersection of Bayesian computation and biomedical science.

Why Stan for Biomedical Applications?
:::

Stan is an excellent tool for biomedical applications because it enables researchers to build sophisticated probabilistic models with high computational efficiency and flexibility. Bayesian inference, which is central to Stan, allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge and provides robust uncertainty quantification—critical in biomedical research where data is often sparse, noisy, or hierarchical. Stan’s dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling ensures efficient and scalable inference, making it particularly useful for complex models such as pharmacokinetics, disease progression modeling, survival analysis, and clinical trial data synthesis. Moreover, its rich modeling language and integration with R, Python, and other statistical computing environments make it accessible to both statisticians and applied scientists. By leveraging Stan, biomedical researchers can generate more reliable estimates, improve predictive accuracy, and ultimately make more informed decisions in healthcare and medicine.
